    abstract = "Multilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key intermediate task which is needed in many areas of NLP. In this paper, we address the well-known issue of data scarcity in NER, especially relevant when moving to a multilingual scenario, and go beyond current approaches to the creation of multilingual silver data for the task. We exploit the texts of Wikipedia and introduce a new methodology based on the effective combination of knowledge-based approaches and neural models, together with a novel domain adaptation technique, to produce high-quality training corpora for NER. We evaluate our datasets extensively on standard benchmarks for NER, yielding substantial improvements up to 6 span-based F1-score points over previous state-of-the-art systems for data creation.",

**Please consider citing our work if you use data and/or code from this repository.**

In a nutshell, WikiNEuRal consists in a novel technique which builds upon a multilingual lexical knowledge base (i.e., [BabelNet](https://babelnet.org/)) and transformer-based architectures (i.e., [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) to produce high-quality annotations for multilingual NER. It shows consistent improvements of up to **6 span-based F1-score points against state-of-the-art alternative** data production methods on common benchmarks for NER. Moreover, in our paper we also present a new approach for creating **interpretable word embeddings** together with a **Domain Adaptation algorithm**, which enable WikiNEuRal to create **domain-specific training corpora**.

Further datasets, such as the combination of WikiNEuRal with gold-standard training data (i.e., **CoNLL**), can be obtained by simply concatenating the two `train.conllu` files together (e.g., `data/conll/en/train.conllu` and `data/wikineural/en/train.conllu` give `CoNLL+WikiNEuRal`).

# WikiNEuRal as a Benchmark (Leaderboard 🏆) 
If you evaluate your NER system on one or more WikiNEuRal test sets, you can **submit** your results on the corresponding [Papers With Code WikiNEuRal Leaderboards](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wikineural), and obtain a **badge** if your system performs well!! 🚀 

You just need to add the **name** of your system, the **score** it achieves (the metric is the Span-Level Macro F1) and **specify if you used additional training data** other than the official WikiNEuRal ones.

**Note**: To compute the Span-Level Macro F1 score you can also use the [conlleval](https://github.com/sighsmile/conlleval) script or the [seqeval](https://pypi.org/project/seqeval/0.0.10/) library in addition to the script in this repository.

# How to use
1. To train 10 models on WikiNEuRal English, run:
    ```
    python run.py -m +train.seed_idx=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 data.datamodule.source=wikineural data.datamodule.language=en
    ```
    **note 1**: we show how to train 10 models on the same training set because in our paper we used exactly 10 different seeds to compute the mean and standard deviation, which were then used to measure the [statistical significance](scripts/significance.py) w.r.t. other training sets.

    **note 2**: for the EN, ES, NL and DE versions of WikiNEuRal, you can combine the train, val and test sets of WikiNEuRal to obtain a larger training set (as we did in the paper), and use the CoNLL splits as validation and testing material (e.g., copy `data/conll/en/val.conllu` into `data/wikineural/en/`). Similarly, for RU and PL you can use the BSNLP splits for validation and testing. For the other languages instead, since no gold-standard data are available, you can use the standard WikiNEuRal splits to validate your model. Finally, for the domain-adapted datasets you can use both the val and test sets of the datasets on which they have been adapted (if available) and the val and test sets of WikiNEuRal for the same language.

2. To produce results for the 10 trained models, run:
    ```
    bash test.sh
    ```
    
    `test.sh` also contains more complex bash for loops that can produce results on multiple datasets / models at once.
